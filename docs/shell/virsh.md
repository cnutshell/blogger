# virsh

## Motivation

I need to manage virtual machines under kvm which is installed on my Gen8 micro-server.

## Introduction

**virsh** is a command line tool for managing guests and the hypevisor. This tool is built on the **libvirt** management API and operates as an alternative to the **xm** tool and the graphical guest Manager **virt-manager**. Unprivileged users can employ this utility for read-only operations.

## Usage

Please refer to [Managing guests with **virsh**](https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.2/Virtualization/chap-Virtualization-Managing_guests_with_virsh.html).
